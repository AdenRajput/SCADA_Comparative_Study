# IEEE DNP3 ITHACA Dataset

This repository contains the IEEE DNP3 ITHACA Dataset, which is part of a larger project to make our code open-source. The dataset includes various attack scenarios and is organized into multiple folders based on different timeouts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

1. **IEEE DNP3 ITHACA DATASET**
2. **CTGAN**
3. **NETSHARE**

### IEEE DNP3 ITHACA DATASET

This folder contains datasets related to different attack scenarios. Each attack dataset is further divided into subfolders based on timeouts. Due to the large size of the dataset, only a sample CSV file used in the experiment is uploaded here. The full dataset can be downloaded from the provided link.

#### Attack Datasets

The attack datasets are organized into the following subfolders based on timeouts:

- 45 seconds
- 60 seconds
- 75 seconds
- 90 seconds
- 120 seconds
- 240 seconds

Each timeout folder contains 12 CSV files categorized by attacker, master, and slave.

### Download the Full Dataset

The full dataset, including all attack scenarios and timeout folders, can be downloaded from the following link: https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/dnp3-intrusion-detection-dataset

### Sample CSV File

The sample CSV file used in the experiment is uploaded in this repository. You can find it in the `IEEE DNP3 ITHACA DATASET` folder.
